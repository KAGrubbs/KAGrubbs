- 🌱 I’m currently learning to apply my knowledge to create a mobile app. I'm also in Computer Architecture and Computer Graphics.
- 🎵 My other interests include books, art, and theater.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love math! I am double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science.
- ✝ My first love is the Lord! One of my favorite verses is Romans 8:38-39
